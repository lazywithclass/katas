THOUGHTS WHILE CODING

first cover the code with tests, so we protect us against misunderstood if / else branches and the likes

grouping items by describe makes it clearer to distinguish the different conditions that apply for them

possibly I lost a branch during the refactor and introduced a bug, that's ok IMHO though, because we can add a test that highlights the bug and have more confidence in future refactorings or feature changes

to refactor add an if at the start of the for loop with a specific item,
like so

if (name === 'Aged Brie') {
  if (items[i].quality < 50) {
    items[i].quality = items[i].quality + 1
  }
  if (items[i].sell_in < 0) {
    item.quality = item.quality + 1
  }
  continue;
}

with a continue ad the end
so we are sure we just deal with that only

as of now there's no need for inheritance, it's already a big step forward in terms of readability, chances for refactoring are there, so if there will be the need we can introduce inheritance in the future

90% of the time was refactoring

did not add code coverage because of the time issuew
but I would've done it normally

RENAME "update_quality" ?
it is also updating the sell_in
just "update"?
